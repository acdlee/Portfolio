TODOs:
1. Projects page
2. Individual projects page (utilize ejs)
3. Chalkboard endpoint
    -> Recieve the request in node
    -> Have the submit button that exports the canvas image and uses
        an image classifier to guess what the image is.
        Do this in index.js so you can utilize Node ML packages.
4. Resume endpoint
    -> Just starts the resume download or displays a page to view the resume.
        It's probably better to render a page and have a resume download button
